# Fishing Store Workshop App

## Overview

Fishing Store Workshop App is a web application for a fishing store owner to manage workshop repair orders and installment payment plans from one workspace. The app focuses on the backend domain for repair tracking, payment history, customer records, and reminder workflows, supported by a clean React UI with boards, tables, charts, and history views.

The target system uses a Java/Spring Boot backend with MySQL persistence. Repair Orders and Installments are modeled as first-class business records with related clients, users, payments, statuses, timestamps, and history. Records should be preserved for reporting and audit purposes, so delete actions for Repair Orders and Installments must be implemented as soft delete instead of physical deletion.

## Goals

1. Allow the store owner or admin user to manage Repair Orders and Installments from a single web app.
2. Track client information, repair progress, installment balances, payments, and historical activity.
3. Provide WhatsApp message/reminder tools for contacting clients about order updates or pending installment payments.
4. Provide a clean dashboard with charts and summaries for repair volume, installment status, collected payments, pending balances, and recent activity.
5. Build a reliable Spring Boot backend with clear DTO, service, repository, entity, and database boundaries.

## Core User Flow

1. The admin user signs in with email and password.
2. The user lands on the Home dashboard and reviews repair order metrics, installment balances, charts, and recent activity.
3. The user navigates between Home, Repair Orders, Installments, History views, and Profile.
4. The user opens the Repair Orders board to view orders by status: Pending, In Progress, Ready, and Completed.
5. The user creates, views, edits, or soft deletes a Repair Order, including client details, selected services, line items, totals, payment records, and notes.
6. The user opens the Installments board or list to view active, completed, and defaulted installment plans.
7. The user creates, views, edits, or soft deletes an Installment, including client details, article description, interest rate, total amount, payment history, pending balance, status, and notes.
8. The user drafts or sends a WhatsApp reminder/message from a Repair Order or Installment context and can review message history.
9. The user searches history to review past orders, installment records, payments, and client activity.

- Display charts for trends, status distribution, and payment progress.
- Show recent activity across Repair Orders and Installments.
- Provide Repair Order and Installment history views for search and review.

### Backend Persistence and Database Integrity

- Use Spring Boot with Java 17 for the backend application.
- Use Spring Data JPA repositories for persistence access.
- Use MySQL as the primary relational database.
- Keep business rules in service classes and expose clean DTOs between service/API layers.
- Maintain database relationships with foreign keys between users, roles, clients, services, repair orders, repair order items, repair order payments, installments, and installment payments.
- Prefer soft delete for business records that must remain visible in history, reporting, and audit workflows.

## Backend Architecture Summary

The backend is organized around a standard Spring Boot layered architecture:

- **Entities**: JPA entities represent database tables and relationships.
- **Repositories**: Spring Data JPA repositories provide persistence operations and query methods.
- **Services**: Service interfaces and implementations contain validation, normalization, lookup, create, update, delete, and business logic.
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects define the shape of data moving through the service and API boundary.
- **Exceptions**: Domain-specific exceptions describe invalid requests, duplicates, resources not found, and resources in use.
- **SQL Schema**: MySQL schema files define production/test tables, relationships, indexes, seed data, and payment summary behavior.
- **REST API Intent**: The backend should expose OpenAPI-documented REST endpoints for authentication, clients, users, services, repair orders, repair order payments, installments, and installment payments.

## Main Data Model

### Users and Roles

- `roles` stores system roles such as Admin and Superadmin.
- `users` stores operator accounts with role, name, email, password, phone, and creation date.
- Repair Orders and Installments reference the user who created them.

### Clients

- `clients` stores customer master data.
- Clients can be referenced by multiple Repair Orders and multiple Installments.
- Client deletion should be restricted when records depend on the client.

### Services

- `services` stores the repair service catalog.
- Service categories include reel repair, rod repair, maintenance, and other.
- Services include active/inactive state and a default price.
- Repair Order items reference services while preserving historical item pricing.

### Repair Orders

- `repair_orders` stores the parent repair job record.
- Each Repair Order belongs to a client and a creating user.
- Each Repair Order can have many `repair_order_items`.
- Each Repair Order can have many `repair_order_payments`.
- Financial summary fields include total, amount paid, and pending amount.
- Status drives the Repair Orders board.

### Installments

- `installments` stores layaway or credit payment plans.
- Each Installment belongs to a client and a creating user.
- Each Installment can have many `installment_payments`.
- Financial summary fields include total amount, amount paid, and pending amount.
- Status tracks whether the plan is active, completed, or defaulted.
